This source code was made by me - Thi Dai Loc, got 0.78 point on Kaggle for problem Titanic https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview

The idea is that we split data into two parts:
- 1st part: 25% of total passenger data which can be trained and predicted by Decision Tree, accuracy ~90%
- 2nd part: the rest 75% of total passenger data is noise data which hard to predict, accuracy ~60%
I know my code is currently quite dirty, will clean later hehe
